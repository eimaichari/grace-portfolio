      <p class="about-description">
        I like to craft solid and scalable frontend products with great user experiences. Highly skilled at progressive enhancement, design systems & UI Engineering. Proven experience building successful products for clients across several countries. As an aspiring web designer, I'm passionate about blending creativity with functionality, experimenting with new technologies, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital spaces. My journey started with simple code experiments, and now I'm dedicated to creating sleek, intuitive websites that not only look great but also perform flawlessly across devices.
